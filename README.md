# Digital Certificates Demo

A simple script demonstrating how digital signatures can be used to verify the authenticity and integrity of a message. 

1. Hash the certificate content. 
2. The CA generates a signature by encrypting the hash from 1. using it's private key.
3. The signature is appended to the certificate. The certificate is now signed.
4. To validate the certificate, hash the certificate content and compare this with the signature decrypted using the CA's public key. If the two are equal then you must know that the signature was generated by the CA (a trusted third-party) and therefore the entire contents of the certificate is legitimate.
